What is an Atom?
In Recoil, the core unit of state is called an Atom.
An atom represents a piece of state that can be shared across components in your app. 
It’s like a global state, but scoped to Recoil’s management system.

Create an Atom:
 To create an atom, you need to import atom from Recoil and define it with a key (which must be unique across the app) and a default value.

import { atom } from 'recoil';

export const backpackState = atom({
  key: 'backpackState', // unique ID (with respect to other atoms/selectors)
  default: [], // default value (can be an empty array or some initial items)
});
